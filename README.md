# Text_Blob_NLP_Library
textBlob is used to perform NLP preprocessing task

I recently explored the TextBlob library in Python, which simplifies various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

With TextBlob, I learned how to:

Tokenize text into words and sentences.
Tag parts of speech for deeper analysis.
Analyze sentiment to gauge the emotional tone of text.
Lemmatize words to their base forms for better normalization.
Correct spelling errors effortlessly.
This hands-on experience has enhanced my understanding of text processing and its applications in data analysis.
